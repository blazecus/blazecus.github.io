<div class = "blog-post">
<p>Welcome to my site. I made this website mainly to share and show off my projects and hobbies. These projects might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>my origami designs</li>
<li>graphics software projects</li>
<li>video game development projects</li>
<li>random other software projects</li>
<li>physical projects (keyboards, random crafts like bows and arrows or forges)</li>
<li>random thoughts and blog posts</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to project posts, I plan to add tutorials and possibly videos from an accompanying youtube channel for many of the projects I end up posting.</p>
<p>The website also functions as a sort of portfolio, considering that I am going to add a lot of software projects on here in the graphics software and game development sections. For professional purposes, my resume is in the top right of the site, and contains my email if you need to contact me for anything.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm Jack, I'm a software engineer based out of Seattle. Other than the hobbies seen on this site, I am into judo, history, fantasy/scifi books, gaming, running/rowing, and I play the banjo.</p>
