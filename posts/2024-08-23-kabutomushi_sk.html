again, sorry for the photography...

<p>Beetles are probably the most popular origami subject - they're perfect for the medium. This is a very complex one, and definitely my favorite of Shuki Kato's models, despite its difficulty. I highly recommend folding this if you have enough time and skill.</p>

some outdoor shots...

<p>I used to keep bess beetles in a jar when I was a kid - I would feed them leaves and bark, and over years they would reduce the food into mulch. Those beetles were weird - they would scream at you if you picked them up. I also sometimes would isolate the "super-worms" I fed to my lizard - they would metamorphose into a beetle that was pretty similar to the bess beetles. I kinda want to keep some beetles now.</p>
<p>I have my own beetle designs coming soon, actually.</p>
