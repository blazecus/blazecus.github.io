A type of longhorn beetle that you can find in the PNW, among other places. My third design.

The proportions are not perfect on the main body, but it's not bad either

<p>My first beetle design! Definitely a milestone for origamists. This one is a simple box-pleated model, with some maneuvering on the abdomen to get the color-changed white spot in the correct location. You may notice that the white spot is larger than in real life - this was on purpose, as I wanted the feature to be easily recognizable. I wrote a post on the process of designing this beetle <a href = https://blazecus.github.io/posts/2024-08-28-bp_beetle.html>here</a> - it has brief explanations of what box pleating does and the general idea of how i came up with the beetle.</p>
<p>Anyway, I also made a YouTube video for this one, which I'm pretty happy about. Unfortunately the folding goes out of frame quite a bit - something I'll definitely work on for the next times.</p>

I found the flat shape of beetles harder to photograph than the humanoid models I've designed in the past.
