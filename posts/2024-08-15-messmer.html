    I actually learned some photography concepts for this one. 
    <br>
    <br>
    </div>
<p>I wanted to make a character from Elden Ring, and I was in the middle of playing the new DLC when I designed this. I settled on Messmer as a subject particularly for his complexity - he has a large spear, requiring lots of extra paper, long snakes in two different directions, and an interesting robe to mimic. He's also one of the best bosses in the game, and the design is cool - so I figured it would make a good origami model.</p>
<p>Ideally, I should have used red paper to depict his real color, but I tried with new mulberry paper that I've never tried before. I gave it a single treatment of MC and started folding. A lot of this is free-folded, although I used BP studio to generally map out where each limb and snake would be. His robes ended up being pretty hard - I probably should have used 3 or 4 flaps entirely, and then I could have shaped it closer to how it should be.</p>

Close-ups!
<br>
<br>
</div>
<p>Here are some close-ups of the the face and upper snake - I am pleased with how the robes ended up looking from the outside, even if their shape isn't like the 3D model. It also made me realize that I didn't really know how to plan out faces/heads - I kinda just planned a few flaps in the same area of similar length, and had to turn a couple into one and use them in an in-efficient manner to get these results. Still - I like how the face looks, just disappointed with not having the correct flaps to make a good helmet.</p>
<p>Here's a reference to the character:</p>
