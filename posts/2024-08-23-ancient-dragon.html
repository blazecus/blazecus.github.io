<p>This is a very common model to see - everyone has folded it. For good reason. It's not the most efficient or advanced model by today's standards, but it certainly looks great. I've folded it a few times actually, but without MC or great paper the results were never good. I think I did really well with the shaping on this fold, though. I've seen a lot of folds, many of them cleaner than this one, but none that I liked the shaping and posing of better than my own.</p>
<p>Most seem to pose the dragon on all fours - but I think having it rear up and curl its claws makes it look more threatening.</p>
